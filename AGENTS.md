## Project Overview

Dawncaster is a mobile rogue-like card game similar to Slay The Spire. This is a static website that provides an alternative interface for browsing Dawncaster game data from the Blightbane API.

The site should follow best practices from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and be responsive for ease of use on small screens.

The site consists of two main pages:

- `cards.html` - Browse and filter game cards, alternate interface for https://blightbane.io/cards
- `talents.html` - Browse and filter talent information, alternate interface for https://blightbane.io/talents

Both pages are standalone HTML files with embedded CSS and JavaScript. There is no build process, package manager, or dependencies beyond dependencies loaded from CDN.

## Architecture

### API Integration

All data comes from the Blightbane API at `https://blightbane.io/api`:

- **Search**: `GET /api/cards?search=&rarity=&category=&type=&banner=&exp=`, cards returned from this endpoint don't have costs
- **Card details**: `GET /api/card/{id}`
- **Talent details**: `GET /api/card/{id}?talent=true`

#### API Query Requirements

**CRITICAL: All query parameters must be present even if empty.** The search API expects:

```
/api/cards?search=&rarity=&category=&type=&banner=&exp=
```

Missing parameters will cause the query to fail. Empty values are valid and return unfiltered results for that parameter.

#### API Best Practices

**NEVER spam the API.** Do NOT:

- Loop through large ranges of card IDs (e.g., `for id in range(1, 2000)`)
- Make rapid sequential requests without rate limiting
- Perform exhaustive searches when targeted queries are possible

**DO use filter parameters intelligently:**

- If you know a card is "rare gold", use `?rarity=2&banner=8`
- If you know the card category, include it in the query
- Use the search parameter for text-based queries
- Combine filters to narrow results before fetching individual card details

#### API Response Format

The API returns HTML markup in description fields, including:

- `<b>` tags for bold text
- `<br>` or `<br/>` tags for line breaks
- Other formatting tags as needed

Descriptions must be sanitized before rendering to prevent XSS attacks.

#### Extracting Filter Values from Blightbane

The Blightbane website is a client-side JavaScript application. The raw HTML does not contain dropdown options - they are dynamically generated by JavaScript. To get the authoritative, up-to-date filter values for use in the search endpoint:

1. **Find the current bundle version:**

   ```bash
   curl -s 'https://blightbane.io' | grep -o 'index.bundle.js?v=[0-9.]*'
   ```

   Example output: `index.bundle.js?v=0.20.5`

2. **Fetch the JavaScript bundle:**

   ```bash
   VERSION="0.20.5"  # Use version from step 1
   curl -s "https://blightbane.io/js/index.bundle.js?v=${VERSION}" > bundle.js
   ```

3. **Extract filter arrays using regex patterns:**

   ```bash
   # Categories
   grep -oP '"Action","Item"[^]]*' bundle.js | head -1

   # Types
   grep -oP '"Melee","Magic"[^]]*' bundle.js | head -1

   # Rarities
   grep -oP '"Common","Uncommon"[^]]*' bundle.js | head -1

   # Banners/Colors
   grep -oP '"Green","Blue","Red","Purple"[^]]*' bundle.js | head -1

   # Expansions
   grep -oP '"Core","Metaprogress"[^]]*' bundle.js | head -1
   ```

- Array index corresponds to the API filter value (e.g., "Rare" is at index 2, so use `?rarity=2`)
- Some filters prepend "None" at index 0 (banners/colors and expansions)

## Local Database Approach

The html files have JavaScript which queries an SQLite database. The database needs to be generated ahead of time by crawling the API.

The `create-db/run.py` script builds a complete SQLite database from the Blightbane API:

```bash
python run create-db/run.py dawncaster-cards.db
```

1. Fetches filter values from Blightbane JavaScript bundle (always up-to-date)
2. Queries all 96 rarity/color combinations to collect all card IDs
3. Fetches detailed info for each card with 0.5s rate limiting (respects API)
4. Sanitizes HTML descriptions (keeps `<br>` tags, strips everything else)
5. FetchesDoes something similar to fetch all talents5. Stores everything in SQLite with STRICT tables and foreign key enforcement

Database contains:

- ~1,672 cards
- Lookup tables: categories, types, rarities, expansions, colors
- Main cards table with foreign keys
- Costs table with resource breakdowns
- Talents

## Functional Programming Style

The code follows a functional approach with:

- Pure render functions that map data to HTML strings
- Separate functions for data fetching and DOM updates
- Immutable data transformations using `map`, `filter`, and `join`

## Development

Install dependencies with `npm i`, only used for running tests.

`npm run start` to start a development server, then open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:4173/cards.html

To run Playwright tests: `npm run test`. Note: this command also runs the development server
